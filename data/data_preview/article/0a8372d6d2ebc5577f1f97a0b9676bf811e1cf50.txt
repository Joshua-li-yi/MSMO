Inter Milan have the financial backing to land Barcelona 's Lionel Messi , according to one of the club 's former stars .
Chinese investors Suning Commerce Group took over ownership of the club in June 2016 , immediately injecting extra capital into the club .
The Serie A side splashed out on Gabriel Barbosa and Joao Mario , and former forward Sandro Mazzola believes the San Siro outfit are poised to splurge again , and have the ability to lure the best in the business to Milan .
` Suning have the strength to get those they want , including Messi , ' he told Il Mattino .
` Now in Serie A there is a preposterous boredom if it were not for Napoli Sarri you would be hard pressed to have fun . '
While there are talks of changes on the field , there are also reports that Inter are contemplating a change of manager , with Diego Simeone set to be targeted by his former club .
However , Mazzola believes that , while the Argentine would certainly improve the club 's fortunes , current boss Stefano Pioli has earned the chance to carry on .
Talking about the club 's recent form , which has seen them slump to seventh , he said : ' I see this collapse , and I think the heads have dropped . The leaders , if any , have to take the team on their shoulders . '

Asked if he felt the appointment of Simeone would turn things around , he replied : ` The level would rise a lot . But I would go on with Pioli . '

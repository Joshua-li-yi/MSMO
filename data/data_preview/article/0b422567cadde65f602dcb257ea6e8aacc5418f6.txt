A climber was dramatically winched to safety from the sea off the Welsh coast last weekend and the whole incident was caught on the helicopter 's on-board camera .
One of a group of climbers fell from a cliff at Minchin Hole , near Swansea , on Saturday and landed five metres below on some rocks .
One of the climbers called 999 and Mumbles and Rhossili Coastguard Rescue Teams were scrambled but were unable to get him out .
Eventually a Coastguard search and rescue helicopter based at St Athan was called in , winched down a stretcher and took him to Swansea Morriston Hospital .
The video catches the dramatic moment as the helicopter 's winchman was lowered into a narrow cliff crevice to reach the injured man .
Coastguard spokesman Jonathan Mustard said : ` This is an amazing example of the teamwork required at an inaccessible location when time is of the essence .
` We send our best wishes to the casualty and hope he makes a swift recovery . '

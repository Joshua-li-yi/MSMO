Stoke go back in for Inter Milan centre-half Jeison Murillo as Ryan Shawcross contract concerns mount

@body
Stoke have rekindled interest in Inter Milan defender Jeison Murillo .
The Colombia international is among the players Inter are willing to sell to help offset their Financial Fair Play restrictions .
Inter want around # 15million for the 25-year-old who has 25 caps for his country .
Stoke have concerns in defence with Ryan Shawcross yet to commit to a new contract . They have considered various options including Mamdaou Sakho at Liverpool and Middlesbrough 's Ben Gibson .
Murillo was discussed earlier this year and is back under consideration .
Despite the speculation over his future , earlier this month Murillo insisted he would be ` going back to Inter ' after his summer break .
Murillo lost his regular starting spot last season but the Colombian made it clear he plans to stay and fight for his place .
' I have three years left on my contract and I 'll be going back to Inter , ' he told Radio Caracol .
' I do n't know anything about the market rumours , right now I just want to take advantage of my holiday . '
Stoke have ruled out a loan deal for midfielder Gianelli Imbula . The 24-year-old will be allowed to leave but Stoke want a permanent sale and want to recoup the bulk of the # 18.3 m they paid for him .

A young woman has revealed how her ex-boyfriend allegedly stabbed her 37 times to the face and body in an attempt to ` ruin ' her looks when she broke up with him .
The 25-year-old woman had ended her on-again and off-again relationship with the 29-year-old man before he allegedly broke in to her home in Turella , in Sydney 's south , and attacked her .
The woman spoke to The Daily Telegraph about the alleged attack detailing how her ex-boyfriend came at her armed with a pair of scissors .
` It was the worst moment of my life . I 've got breast implants and he even tried to pop my implants , he tried to cut my nipple off , ' she said .
` It really seems like he has tried to ruin the way I look . '
The woman said there was ` blood everywhere ' during the alleged frenzied attack .
The man went on the run for four days after the alleged attack on his ex-girlfriend but was soon caught by police in Tamworth .
He was charged with attempted murder , wound person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm , and break and enter to inflict grievous bodily harm .

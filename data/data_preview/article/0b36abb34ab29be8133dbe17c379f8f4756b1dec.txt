Ljubomir Fejsa is a serial winner whose league title streak puts Zlatan Ibrahimovic 's in the shade ... Benfica 's lucky charm has won NINE in a row

Manchester United are set to bring in Victor Lindelof to boost their Premier League title hopes next season but have they raided Benfica for the wrong player ?
If Jose Mourinho wanted a sure thing next season he probably should have overlooked Lindelof in favour of a man who last failed to pick up a league winner 's medal in 2008 .
Serbian midfielder Ljubomir Fejsa has won nine consecutive league titles with three different clubs in three different countries , he is as close as it comes to guaranteed success .
Fejsa , an unassuming holding midfielder , is probably not the man to return the league title to Old Trafford but his winning streak is longer than that of the superstar Mourinho brought in last summer with designs on a the same target : Zlatan Ibrahimovic .
Ibrahimovic 's eight seasons in a row of league winners ' medals from 2003-04 to 2010-11 -LRB- with two from Juventus later stripped -RRB- lags just behind Fejsa 's personal tally .
Beginning with Partizan Belgrade 's 2008-09 Serbian SuperLiga success , Fejsa has enjoyed a near-decade of dominance .
He picked up two more titles with Partizan before moving to perennial Greek Superleague winners in Olympiacos in 2011 . They claimed two consecutive top spots before his move to Benfica after the first game of the 2013-14 season .
Ljubomir Fejsa , 28 , is a Serbian midfielder who plays for Benfica . A serial league title winner , with nine successful campaigns in his last nine seasons , he has represented Serbia 23 times .
Fejsa began his career with the now defunct Hadjuk Kula before moving to Partizan Belgrade where his incredible streak began . He won three titles in a row in Belgrade before a move to Olympiacos in 2011 where two more crowns followed .
Switching Piraeus for Lisbon in 2013 saw the run continue with Fejsa winning the league in each of his four campaigns with the Eagles .
If the Greek FA were feeling generous Fejsa might well have picked up a league medal for that season too , with Olympiacos claiming their 41st title that season .
Fejsa 's switch to Lisbon helped Benfica end Porto 's three years of Primeira Liga dominance . Four seasons on and Fejsa is yet to end a campaign in Portugal without a league medal around his neck .
He may be a figure of fortune but Fejsa has hardly been a big contributor . Last season 's 23 league appearances took his tally to 65 in four seasons with just one goal . In Greece he was hardly a regular either , featuring just 20 times over two injury-blighted league campaigns .
Only with Partizan was he a consistent starter , although even there his final season was disrupted by a cruciate ligament injury that saw him play just two league games .
The Serbian international has only failed to lift silverware with one club , the now-defunct Hadjuk Kula , where he began his in 2005 and 2008 . Financial problems saw Kula dissolved in 2013 .
League titles are not the only trophies Fejsa has in his medal collection . The 28-year-old boasts two Serbian Cup-winners medals , another two from Greece and five from Portugal -LRB- two Portuguese FA cups and three league cups -RRB- .

A driver was spotted helping a pensioner cross a busy road by blocking the traffic in eastern China .
Mr Xu was driving on a busy road in Shandong province last Friday when he saw an elderly pedestrian pushing her own wheelchair on a crossing .
Video from a surveillance camera shows the man driving alongside her until she reached the other side of the road safely .
The incident occurred at an intersection in Laizhou on the morning of June 9 , according to state media CCTV .
The pensioner was seen moving with her wheelchair slowly in the middle of the road junction towards the south .
As traffic lights changed , vehicles travelling to the east were set to drive past the crossing , posing danger to the elderly pedestrian .
Mr Xu , driving in his black vehicle , stopped in front of the crossing .
He drove towards the woman slowly and blocked the red car behind him .
The man told a CCTV reporter that he was afraid that the elderly pedestrian would be hit by vehicles .
According to China 's Road Traffic Safety Law , vehicles should slow down at the zebra crossing to let pedestrians cross the road .
A local traffic officer praised the driver by saying , ` he has set a precedent ' .
Thousands of online users discussed on the clip posted to Weibo .
` It 's so heart warming ! ' One user noted .
` Driver of the red car from behind must be confused , ' another user said .
However , a third user disagreed with the driver 's practice by saying : ` What he did could be quite dangerous for himself and other vehicles as well . '

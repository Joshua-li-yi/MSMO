The baby panda that loves a rocking horse : Cute cub ca n't get enough of her new toy

@body
A baby panda was seen happily riding her favourite rocking horse at her home in China .
Qiyi , a nine-month old giant panda , was seen enjoying her time on a red rocking horse at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding , a video posted by People 's Daily to Youtube shows .
Although the bear had a great workout , she was eventually distracted by another keeper that approached her with apples .
The beginning of the 23-second clip shows Qiyi enjoying her ride on a red rocking horse as a female keeper keeps watch .
The toy is a gift from a fan of the female cub , according to a Weibo post of iPanda , a live panda-cam operated by Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding .

However , her toy lost its allure when the panda saw a keeper approaching her with her favourite fruit - apple .
Although another keeper tried rocking her on the horse , she pushed away the keeper 's hands .
Eyeing the apple , she quickly got off the toy and went to the keeper for apples .
It was not known when the video was filmed .

The food-loving Qiyi , born in July 2016 , has a twin sister named Qi Guo .
Both are now being kept at a young panda nursery inside a Chinese panda breeding centre , according to iPanda .
They will be transferred to other parts of the base after reaching 1.5 years old .

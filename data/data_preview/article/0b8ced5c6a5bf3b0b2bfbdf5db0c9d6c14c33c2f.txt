Dina Asher-Smith in fitness race to secure automatic qualification for the World Championships in London

@body
Dina Asher-Smith is in a race against time to secure automatic qualification for August 's World Championships in London , with her participation in the British trials next month not yet certain .
The fastest female sprinter in British history is attempting to prove she has fully recovered from a broken foot , with the national trials just a fortnight away on July 1 and 2 .
Sportsmail understands there are no guarantees the hugely talented 21-year-old will be able to run both 100m and 200m at the meet in Birmingham , though it is thought likely she will run the latter at the trials .
If she missed the 100m , she would need to hit the 11.26 sec qualifying standard at the Anniversary Games in London on July 9 and then rely on a discretionary pick for one of the three 100m spots available for the British team at the worlds .
Given her credentials as Britain 's record holder at 100m and 200m , it would be highly unlikely that the European champion would be overlooked if she met the qualifying time , though proving her fitness remains the key obstacle .
The Londoner had been on a rapid trajectory prior to the injury in February , having taken the 200m European crown in 2016 and Olympic bronze in the 4x100m in Rio .
But the freak injury has cast doubt on her prospects at her home championships , with Asher-Smith having rolled her ankle during a jumping exercise . The setback kept her out of the majority of the indoor season and the outdoor campaign to date .

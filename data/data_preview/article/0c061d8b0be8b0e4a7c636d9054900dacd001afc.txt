Oldest primate skeleton ever found shows Earth 's earliest primates lived in the treetops

@body
Scientists have long debated the habitat of Earth 's earliest primates .
Now , a new study on 62-million-year-old bones reveals the small creatures ` undoubtedly lived in trees , ' squashing earlier arguments that claimed they were built for life on the ground .
The discovery of the oldest known partial primate skeleton in New Mexico has provided anatomical evidence on their lifestyle , indicating that they were better equipped to climb trees and hang onto branches .
Thomas Williamson , curator of paleontology at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science , discovered the bones along with his sons at the San Juan Basin .
Plesiadapiforms , an extinct group of primates , are thought to be the earliest primates , as they appear in the fossil record just after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs .
Previously , scientists based their assumptions on the discovery of teeth and jaws , which suggested that they searched the ground for insects .
But , the partial skeleton offers more than 20 bones for analysis , revealing extensive new insight on their lives .

The researchers say these creatures may have been ` transitional ' between other types of mammals and today 's primates .
They 're known to have had outward-facing eyes , and were far more dependent on smell than modern primates .
The Torrenjonia specimen was identified mostly by its dental traits , the researchers say .
With the new bone specimens , they 've concluded these mammals lived in the trees , not on the ground .
Researchers now say they lived in the trees , not on the ground .
` This is the oldest partial skeleton of a plesiadapiform , and it shows that they undoubtedly lived in trees , ' said lead author Stephen Chester , an assistant professor at Brooklyn College , City University of New York , and curatorial affiliate of vertebrate paleontology at the Yale Peabody Museum .
` We now have anatomical evidence from the shoulder , elbow , hip , knee , and ankle joints that allows us to assess where these animals lived in a way that was impossible when we only had their teeth and jaws . '

` To find a skeleton like this , even though it appears a little scrappy , is an exciting discovery that brings a lot of new data to bear on the study of the origin and early evolution of primates , ' said Eric Sargis , professor of anthropology at Yale University , and senior author of the study .
The discovery could finally put the debate to rest , with ample evidence to suggest these creatures lived in the trees .
It further supports analyses from other skeletal remains , which suggest all of the oldest primates found so far were also tree-dwellers .

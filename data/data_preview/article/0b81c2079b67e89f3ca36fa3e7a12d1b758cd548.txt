A kangaroo has been found shot dead and tied to a chair in an ` appalling and immoral ' act of animal cruelty .
The animal was left on a Melbourne roadside posed in a chair wearing a leopard print costume and holding a bottle of ouzo .
It was found on Plenty Road , Mernda in May and the Department of Environment , Land , Water and Planning released a photo on Tuesday calling for information .
` This is appalling and immoral behaviour . The kangaroo had been shot at least three times prior to it being arranged in the chair , ' DELWP Senior Investigator Mike Sverns said on Tuesday .
` It would have taken some time to stage the kangaroo in that position on the side of the road .
` We are certain that someone would have seen something , given the public area and traffic flow of this main road . '
According to DELWP penalties for killing wildlife range from $ 7,500 to $ 36,500 or up to 24 months imprisonment .

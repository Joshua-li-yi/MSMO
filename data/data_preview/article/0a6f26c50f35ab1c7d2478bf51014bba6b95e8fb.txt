Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso has revealed how he nearly joined Barcelona before he moved to Real Madrid .
Alonso left Liverpool for Madrid back in 2009 , going to enjoy a successful spell with the La Liga giants by winning the league , Champions League , Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup .
However , Alonso 's career path could have looked much different if he had joined up with Pep Guardiola at Madrid 's rivals Barcelona .
And Alonso , who is retiring at the end of the season following a stellar career for both club and country , has revealed that Guardiola wanted to sign him before the emergence of Sergio Busquets .
` It happened not long before I left for Real Madrid , ' Alonso told El Pais .
` Liverpool told me that they wanted to sell me , -LSB- manager at that time , Rafael -RSB- Benitez too , and Pep showed an interest in my situation .
` He wanted to sign me because , as he told Rafa , I was the type of player who would fit his -LSB- playing -RSB- model . But he had doubts because Busquets had just come through and had the makings of a tremendous player .
` Guardiola chose him , and he was n't proved wrong . '
Alonso has enjoyed a successful season so far with Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich , who sit eight points clear at the top of the table .
The 35-year-old faces his former club on Tuesday night at the Bernabeu as Bayern look to overcome a 2-1 deficit in their quarter-final Champions League second-leg clash .

Manchester United 's FA Cup fourth round victory over Wigan draws TV audience of 5.3 m but Sutton 's win against Leeds pulls in just 500,000

@body
Manchester United 's win against Wigan drew the largest television audience of the six FA Cup fourth round ties screened live .
More than five million viewers tuned into BBC One to see United coast to a 4-0 victory at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon .
Of BT Sport 's three ties across the weekend , the best viewing figures were recorded for Arsenal 's 5-0 win at Southampton on Saturday evening .
Manchester United 4 Wigan 0 -LRB- 4pm Sunday -RRB- , BBC One : 5.3 million -LRB- peak -RRB-
Derby 2 Leicester 2 -LRB- 7.55 pm Friday -RRB- , BBC One : 4.3 million
Millwall 1 Watford 0 -LRB- noon Sunday -RRB- , BBC One : 2.5 million
Southampton 0 Arsenal 5 -LRB- 5.30 pm Saturday -RRB- , BT Sport : 800,000
Sutton 1 Leeds 0 -LRB- 2pm Sunday -RRB- , BT Sport : 500,000
Kick-off times played a part but the bigger clubs with more fans simply attract more viewers .
The television companies will not be ruled purely by viewing figures and the BBC made it clear , with hindsight , they would have preferred to show Lincoln 's win against Brighton rather than Manchester United but it is a persuasive argument .
And the reason why United have been live on TV for 56 consecutive FA Cup ties .
Sutton 's historic win against Leeds delivered a classic FA Cup shock on Sunday and was shown free-to-air and yet fewer than 500,000 tuned in to watch .
Millwall , which also produced an upset , when third tier beat the top flight , drew the smallest audience of the three games on the BBC , with 2.5 m.

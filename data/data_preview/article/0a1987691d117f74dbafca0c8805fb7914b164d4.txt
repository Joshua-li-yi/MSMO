Room with a view ! Hilarious moment an elderly lady tells a bystander to move out of the way so she can see naked bikers

@body
An elderly lady was filmed telling a pedestrian to move out of the way so she could observe a naked bike ride .
Footage shows the unnamed woman sitting in the window of Betty 's tearoom in York during the annual event with a male friend .
The pair are seen chatting away happily before she taps on the window and tells a man , who is leaning against the cafe 's glass front , to move out of the way .
Her fellow observer , who is sat beside her , laughs at her actions while eating a bowl of soup .
After the man moved , the woman , who has not yet been identified , stuck her thumb up at him - before going back to admiring the bizarre views .

It was captured during York 's annual naked bike ride as the participants dismounted in St Helen 's Square and held a minutes silence for the people who died in traffic accidents .

However , not everyone was keen to watch the cyclists whizz around the historic city on Saturday , June 24 .
One Facebook user wrote : ` It 's disgusting and an excuse for these people to abuse the situation . I 'd have called the police if I thought they would intervene .
` By you promoting this you are actively encouraging this blatant abuse of the purpose of this event . Shame on you . '
But North Yorkshire Police say the law surrounding exposure applies only if there is an intention of causing alarm or distress .
The force is satisfied that this was n't the intention of the people who participated in this organised event .

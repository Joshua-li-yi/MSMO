Queen Anne Stakes winner Tepin retires after owner Robert Masterson admits ` she just is n't interested in running any more '

The 2016 Queen Anne Stakes winner Tepin has been retired after losing her enthusiasm for racing , owner Robert Masterson has said .
Winner of the Breeders ' Cup Mile in 2015 , she was narrowly beaten on what was her final career start when attempting a repeat success in the same race at Santa Anita in November .
The six-year-old mare 's finest hour was at Royal Ascot last year when Mark Casse 's stable star overcame the long journey from North America and the soft ground to claim the Queen Anne by half a length .
Masterson told the Thoroughbred Daily News : ` There is nothing physically wrong with her . She just is n't interested in running any more .
` There are no plans to breed her this year . It 's too late , and we 've not made any decision on her future .
` After she refused to work at Palm Meadows , she was moved to Churchill to see if a change of venue would improve her attitude towards racing , and she basically has no interest in it any more .
` She was always an enthusiastic worker , and enthusiastic in the mornings and about racing , and she is not any more . '
Tepin won 13 of her 23 races , six of which came at the highest level , and earned over # 2.9 million in prize-money .
Norman Casse , assistant trainer to his father , said on Twitter : ` Tepin took us places and achieved things we had only dreamt about . We will be forever grateful .
` Happy Retirement - All Hail The Queen . '

` Katherine Jenkins OBE for what ? ' Furious David Beckham slammed soprano for ` singing at the rugby and taking coke ' as he railed against not getting a knighthood , hacked emails suggest

@body
Hacked emails suggest that David Beckham was less than happy with the decision to award classical music singer Katherine Jenkins with an OBE .
Beckham allegedly wrote an email to his PR manager , Simon Oliveira , indicating his fury that she had been handed an OBE after he missed out on the knighthood .
When Jenkins was awarded an OBE in 2013 - the same honour Beckham holds - the decision was allegedly branded a ` f ****** joke . '
The ex-England captain , who himself received the honour a decade earlier , is reported to have sent a furious email to Oliveira , lambasting the decision by the honour 's committee .
In it , he allegedly wrote : ` Katherine Jenkins OBE for what ? Singing at the rugby and going to see the troops plus taking coke . F ****** joke . '
The Welsh soprano had previously admitted that her life was almost ruined by cocaine and ecstasy in an exclusive with Piers Morgan for the Mail on Sunday .
She turned her life around when , at the age of 23 in 2003 , she was offered a six-album deal by Universal Records worth over # 1million , and vowed not to waste her talents .
And she later said she was ` humbled ' to be bestowed with the honour .
The hacked emails also suggest allegations surrounding his stance in the Scottish referendum and investing in loss-making companies to reduce his tax bill .
Beckham 's representatives dismissed the claims , stating that the emails had been ` hacked and doctored ' from a private account .
A spokesperson for David Beckham said : ` This story is based on outdated material taken out of context from hacked and doctored private emails from a third party server and gives a deliberately inaccurate picture .
` David Beckham and UNICEF have had a powerful partnership in support of children for over 15 years . The David Beckham 7 Fund specifically has raised millions of pounds and helped millions of vulnerable children around the world .
` David Beckham has given significant time and energy and has made personal financial donations to the 7 Fund and this commitment will continue long term .
` Before establishing the 7 Fund , David had supported UNICEF and a number of other charities over many years , including donating his entire earnings from PSG during his time playing there .
` David and UNICEF are rightly proud of what they have and will continue to achieve together and are happy to let the facts speak for themselves . '

Inside the homes of the last Ethiopian Rastas : A rare glimpse into the lives of the slave descendants who were given a home in Africa by the Rastafarian ` messiah '

@body
A stunning set of photographs reveal the unlikely life of the 300 Rastafarians living in Ethiopia having migrated from the UK , France and Jamaica .
Rastafarianism - which became global in the 1960s and 70s with the music of reggae stars and committed Rastas Bob Marley and Jimmy Cliff - first emerged as a spiritual movement in the 1930s among descendants of African slaves in Jamaica , who adopted Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie as their messiah at a time when he stood out as the only independent black monarch in Africa .
A supporter of decolonisation and cooperation among African states then largely under European control , Haile Selassie in the 1950s set aside 500 acres in Shashamane to welcome back descendants of slaves seeking to return home .
They did , and Shashamane is today home to around 300 Rastas , though the population has dwindled from its peak , which at one point stood at 2,000 people about 150 miles from the capital of Addis Ababa .
Nearly 8,000 miles separate Jamaica and Ethiopia , but the Rastafarian community revered Selassie and considered him their God .
When he died in 1975 , his followers called it Ethiopia 's last ever Emperor 's ` disappearance ' , and not his death , refusing to believe he had passed away .

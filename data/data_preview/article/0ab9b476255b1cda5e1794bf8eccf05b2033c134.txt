Arsenal are pressing ahead with plans to appoint their first-ever director of football , with former player Marc Overmars among the early contenders for the role .
In a move that is unlikely to be well received by under-fire boss Arsene Wenger , the club are continuing with their search for a new football figurehead .
Arsenal chiefs want a candidate to not only be in charge of club transfers , but also oversee the entire footballing ethos .
Wenger has become the single most important figure , in a football sense , at the club during his 21-year reign - having the final say on transfer and team matters .
How the Frenchman would react to having to work alongside a director of football remains to be seen , but the club are resolved to making the appointment .
The club have started making early overtures regarding an appointment and Sportsmail understands Overmars , who is currently director of football at Ajax , is someone who interests the club .
Overmars spent three years with Arsenal , winning the Double playing under Wenger in 1998 .

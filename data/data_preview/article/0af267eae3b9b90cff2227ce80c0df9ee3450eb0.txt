Leicester stars including Jamie Vardy played through FA Cup draw at Derby with stomach bug

@body
Leicester 's efforts in the 2-2 FA Cup draw at Derby were affected by a number of players suffering from a stomach bug .
Wes Morgan , Robert Huth , Danny Simpson and Jamie Vardy were among those to battle against significant ill effects .
Leicester believe the issue will have cleared up by Tuesday 's trip to Burnley but the virus appeared to undermine performance levels at Pride Park , when Morgan 's header four minutes from time averted an upset .
Claudio Ranieri said : ` It was very important not to lose , we fought a lot to equalise . It was important for our confidence -- now we have another match it is okay .
' I love it when we show this character -- after this anything is possible .
` My mind now goes to Burnley because it is a very important match . '
Riyad Mahrez is expected to come back into the starting line-up at Turf Moor , having been sent on as a second-half substitute against Derby less than 48 hours after returning from the Africa Cup of Nations .
' I was so in doubt to play with Riyad because he was so tired , ' Ranieri admitted . ` At the beginning he does n't want to come but he played very well . '

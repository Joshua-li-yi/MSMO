Terrorist leader , 35 , is allowed to MARRY while in prison in Belgium in a move that could stop him being deported back to Morocco

@body
Belgium 's most notorious terror recruiter has been allowed to marry the mother of his three children from behind bars .
Fouad Belkacem , 35 , wed the woman in Hasselt prison several weeks ago in a move that activists and politicians fear could stop him being deported back to Morocco .
Under the alias of Abu Imran , Belkacem ran the Islamist website Sharia4Belgium which aimed to turn the European nation into an Islamic state .
Belkacem openly praised Osama bin Laden and called for the implementation of sharia law , including the death penalty for homosexuals .
He also spent years recruiting jihadist fighters and encouraging them to go and fight in Syria against Bashar al-Assad .
In early 2015 Belkacem was sentenced to twelve years behind bars and handed a # 26,000 fine by a court in Antwerp .
Belgian authorities have already started a procedure to strip him of his passport and nationality , which would mean he would be deported after serving his sentence .
Antwerp alderwoman Zuhal Demir revealed she denied permission for the marriage three times before local authorities approved the union .
In a furious Facebook post , Ms Demir said : ` He detests our laws but used them to legally to marry . To what end ?
` We owe this unscrupulous gentleman nothing . I hope that deportation after jail time is still possible . '
Ms Demir , whose parents are Alevi Kurds from Turkey , branded the affair ' a painful missed opportunity . '

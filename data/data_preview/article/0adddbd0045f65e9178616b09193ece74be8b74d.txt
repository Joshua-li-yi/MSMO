School superintendent Mimi Webb told WCPO Cincinnati that the design was supposed to show ` how far we have come in society while acknowledging that we need to do more as a society ' as part of a ` Breaking the Chains ' theme .
Berry told the station : ' I feel like that door made her ashamed of who she is . '
Student Cheran Sherman had helped design the door and told WCPO it was about overcoming ` the hatred and all the bad things that happened during the Jim Crow Era . '
The poster was put on the door in a non-finished form , the school said .
The ` White Entrance ' and ` Colored Entrance ' signs were removed from the finished product .
Sherman added that the school has always celebrated Black History Month well .
Berry told WCPO that she does not blame the student but added that not all students knew what the door meant .

The school said it was all a misunderstanding .

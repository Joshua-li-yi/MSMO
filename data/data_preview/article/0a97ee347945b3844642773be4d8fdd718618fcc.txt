Tottenham full-back Kieran Trippier has the bragging rights over next door neighbour Heurelho Gomes after 4-0 victory over Watford

@body
Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes will want to keep his curtains closed and avoid answering the door for the next few days .
That 's because next door neighbour Kieran Trippier may be tempted to rub in the fact that Tottenham put four goals past him on Saturday .
Tottenham 's 4-0 win kept them in the chase for the Premier League title as Watford crumbled at White Hart Lane , where Gomes spent six years .
Afterwards Trippier swapped shirts with Gomes -- because the two live next door to one another .
` We are neighbours so I asked him if I could have his shirt , ' Trippier said . I get on really well with him and we chat a lot .
` He 's a top guy . But I think the next time I knock to ask if I can borrow a cup of milk he might slam the door in my face . '
Harry Kane started on the substitutes ' bench but was brought on when Tottenham were already 4-0 up . Dele Alli , Eric Dier and Son Heung-min got their goals .
Trippier thinks it shows they do n't have to rely on their star striker to score .
` You can see there is now quality throughout the team , on the bench and even those not in the squad , ' Trippier continued .
` We have a quality group here and when H is not playing we have a lot of lads who can score a lot of goals .
` Sonny is into double figures now , Dele scored again , Christian -LRB- Eriksen -RRB- has been scoring . There are goals all over the park . '

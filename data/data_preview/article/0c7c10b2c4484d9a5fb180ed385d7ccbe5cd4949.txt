A purrrfect trick : Confused cat pounces on ` moving snakes ' after becoming freaking out over optical illusion

@body
A cat owner has posted a hilarious video of their pet freaking out over the famous Rotating Snakes optical illusion .
The footage , which has garnered almost a million views since it was posted on YouTube by Ryan Kotzin on Saturday , features adorable gray kitty Peter .
The confused cat keeps trying to pounce on the ` moving ' snakes until finally giving up and taking a bite out of the offending piece of paper .
The well known snake image is a design by Kitaoka Akiyoshi .

When the eye moves over the circles those which are not focused on appear to be rotating . This is referred to by scientists as ` peripheral drift illusion ' -LRB- PDI -RRB- and was first reported in 1999 .
Some fellow internet users have questioned whether the video is real .
But Peter is n't the only feline to have become mesmerized by the rotating snakes .
In 2013 , a Swedish YouTuber by the username Rasmusab , posted a video with the title : ` My cat can see the rotating snake illusion ! '
It showed his cat pouncing on the patterns as they appeared to shift .
Website io9.com states that cats should be able to see the optical illusion .
` The mammalian visual system is pretty highly conserved , ' the website reports , ` plus , scientists still are n't totally clear on the mechanisms at work when humans fall for it . '

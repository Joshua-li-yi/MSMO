Mamadou Sakho continues break in France as Crystal Palace defender enjoys family outing to Parc Asterix

@body
Mamadou Sakho continues to enjoy his homeland during a break from Crystal Palace duty as he spent the day with his family at Parc Asterix .
The theme park is based on the famous French fictional duo Asterix and Obilix and Sakho enjoyed the attractions with his wife Madja and two daughters , Aida and Sienna .
Parc Asterix is just outside of Paris , Sakho 's original home having spent six years with PSG , and boasts a number of roller-coasters and dressed up characters from Asterix 's adventures .
Sakho is clearly enjoying time in Paris as he previously posed in front of the Eiffel Tower with a few Crystal Palace team-mates following their 2-2 draw against Leicester on Saturday .
Wilfried Zaha , Bakary Sako , and Christian Benteke joined their Liverpool loanee in taking in all Paris has to offer before the dominant centre-back re-joined his family .
Sam Allardyce 's side have appeared far more solid with Sakho in the heart of their defence since the 27-year-old joined in January .
A recent upturn in form has seen the club drift away from the threat of relegation with the team currently in 15th place .
Palace are seven points clear of the drop zone and also have the advantage of a game in hand over the teams around them .
There could still be some twists to come in their own roller-coaster of a season with trips to Liverpool , Manchester City and Manchester United to come .

@body
The largest-ever gathering of British police officers will assemble in London tomorrow for the funeral of Westminster attack hero PC Keith Palmer .
Upwards of 5,000 men and women from every force in the UK are expected to line the route to Southwark Cathedral for the service , which starts at 2pm .
Changing cubicles are being provided for the officers , who have been advised not to wear their uniforms when travelling to the funeral .
An estimated 40-50 ,000 members of the public are expected to join them in paying tribute to the murdered constable .
Ken Marsh , chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation , said the response had been ` incredible ' .
He added : ` The public are as appalled by what happened as the police . At times they can be our biggest critics but when something like this happens they come together with us , because they do n't like someone hurting one of their own .

` I ca n't recall an occasion like this in regard to the number of officers who will be there , but we must not lose sight of the fact that it is a family funeral . It is for Keith 's family and we have made sure we have done everything his wife wants because , first and foremost , it is for her to mourn her husband . '
Unarmed PC Palmer , 48 , was stabbed to death in the terror attack on March 22 , when he tried to stop Muslim extremist Khalid Masood running into the Palace of Westminster armed with two knives .
Masood killed four others before being shot dead by an armed officer .

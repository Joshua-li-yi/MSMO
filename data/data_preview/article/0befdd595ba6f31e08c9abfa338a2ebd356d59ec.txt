Nigel Clough to manage Burton against QPR before deciding on Nottingham Forest job offer

@body
Nigel Clough will take charge of Burton Albion 's match at Queens Park Rangers on Saturday before deciding whether to take over at Nottingham Forest .
The manager held talks with Burton chairman Ben Robinson on Friday after an approach by Forest owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi .
Clough has admitted he feels an emotional pull to the club where his father Brian has legendary status and he himself played more than 300 games between 1984 and 1993 .
But he also feels deep loyalty to Burton and Robinson , who gave him his first job in management .
Robinson said : ` We have had an approach from Nottingham Forest and Nigel spoke with me about it .
` He will be in charge at QPR and we 've agreed to leave it until after the game .
` It 's obviously a huge decision for him and we will probably know more on Monday . '

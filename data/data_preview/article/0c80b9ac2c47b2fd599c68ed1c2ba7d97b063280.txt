@body
A sassy schoolboy was mortified when he shaved off his eyebrows and his mother drew on some unconventional replacements .
Justine Arce , from Missouri , U.S. , decided her son Julius needed a punishment he would n't forget when she realised he had been playing with razors .
Julius had completely removed both of his eyebrows but Ms Acre had a solution .
Using a black eyeliner she drew him on some fancy new ones and told him he was not allowed to wash them off .
However , her son was not impressed when he saw his new facial feature .
He said : ` You are in big trouble . This is so ugly .
` You do n't know how to make regular eyebrows and just trace over my eyebrows , or from pictures ! '
His mother could not stop giggling as her son told her exactly what he thought of her design skills .

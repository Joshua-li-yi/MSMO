Chinese President Xi Jinping stops for an unusaul sight-seeing trip in Anchorage while on his way home from talks with Trump in Mar-a-Lago

@body
Chinese President Xi Jinping was able to take in views Friday night of the natural beauty that Alaska has to offer .
The state 's governor hopes this will lead to an increased appetite in the world 's most populous nation for more natural resources from Alaska .
Xi requested time with Gov. Bill Walker Friday night as the Chinese delegation 's plane made a refueling stop in Alaska 's largest city following meetings with President Donald Trump in Florida .
His wife and the Chinese delegation stepped off the Boeing 747 and were greeted by Walker , his wife and several dignitaries .
The visitors and their hosts drove off in a line of SUVs , limos and other vehicles in 40-degree weather under blue skies .
The sightseeing tour will include a stop at Beluga Point , a pullout on the scenic Seward Highway about 15 miles south of Anchorage .
The pullout offers a stunning view of the snow-capped Chugach Mountains and Turnagain Arm in Alaska 's Cook Inlet .
The waters are home to the endangered Beluga whale .
Walker said he was eager to tell Xi about the abundance of Alaska 's resource development opportunities .
` We have tremendous potential in our oil and gas , tourism , fish , air cargo and mineral resource industries , ' Walker said in a statement issued before the meeting .
For Walker , even just a few hours of time with the president of the world 's largest country can pay dividends .
China is the state 's top export market , buying nearly $ 1.2 billion worth of goods in 2016 , according to the US Census Bureau .
The next top international market was Japan , at nearly $ 820 million , followed by South Korea , at $ 730 million .
Chris Hladick , the commissioner of the state 's Commerce department , called the visit by the Chinese delegation a ` once-in-a lifetime opportunity . '
` We 're not even shown on the map for the United States , ' he said , a nod to Alaska and Hawaii often being left off of maps of the US .
' I think this is an extremely valuable opportunity to meet with our largest trade partner face to face . '
The state 's top export product to China ? Fish , accounting for 58 percent .
Frozen cod and flat fish , such as halibut , topped a lengthy list of fisheries products , which also included frozen salmon and pollock .
A distant second on the export list are minerals and ores , accounting for 27 percent .
Included in that last year was about $ 130 million of precious metals , which Hladick said was likely gold from the Fairbanks area .
Lower-tier exports included oil , wood , scrap metal and airplane parts .
Hladick sees China as a potential market for Alaska coal and hoped to raise the issue with Chinese officials during their visit .
` It 's meetings like this that spark interest and then you follow up , ' Hladick said .
Having your largest trade partner drop in for a meeting is fortuitous when the state is in tough financial straits because of a prolonged period of low oil prices .
Hladick said he 'd be happy to get a 45-minute meeting with the Chinese trade minister .
Walker has been courting Asian markets - particularly Japan and South Korea - in trying to drum up interest in a liquefied natural gas project the state is pursuing .
State officials would n't say if Walker would bring up the natural gas pipeline , which is in its early stages , during his visit with Xi , but it seemed unlikely that he would n't take time to tout the multi-billion dollar project that would take natural gas from Alaska 's North Slope to a plant on the state 's coast , where it would be liquefied and shipped .
Xi is the second major world leader to spend time in Alaska 's largest city in the last few years .
US President Barack Obama used a three-day trip to Anchorage in 2015 to showcase the impact of climate change .
King Harald V of Norway also made an official visit to Anchorage a few months before Obama .
Alaska 's location provides a natural stopping point for world leaders to make refueling stops , and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage has hosted many presidents over the years for these short stints .
President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II met in 1984 during refueling stops at the airport in Fairbanks .
Their paths were crossing as one finished and one began trips to Asia .
